# Development Log

## Day 1 - Initial Setup
**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed
- Set up project structure
- Broken PDF extraction
- Simple test implementation

### Issues
- Environment setup challenges
- Dependency management issues

## Day 2 - PDF Extraction Refinement
**Date:** [Current Date]

### Completed
- Fixed and Properly Tested PDF extraction pipeline
- Made Dev log, and Technical Doc
- Properly Fixed and Tested semantic Chunking implementation
- Properly Fixed and Tested Embedding generation process
- Implemented and verified Chroma Vector Database with abstraction layer for local development
-Successfully implemented and tested the entire RAG pipeline from document extraction to vector storage. The complete workflow now functions properly: PDF extraction â†’ semantic chunking â†’ embedding generation â†’ vector database storage. Tested with multiple documents, processing 3816 chunks across 5 files into the ChromaDB vector store.
- **MILESTONE**: Successfully implemented and tested the entire RAG pipeline from document extraction to vector storage. The complete workflow now functions properly:
  - PDF extraction â†’ semantic chunking â†’ embedding generation â†’ vector database storage
  - Tested with multiple documents, processing 3816 chunks across 5 files into the ChromaDB vector store

### Implementation Plan (Reference)
- âœ… Start with Chroma locally for initial development
  - Implemented ChromaDB as free, open-source vector DB for development
  - Created working vector store implementation with search capabilities
- âœ… Implement an abstraction layer in code
  - Designed VectorStoreBase interface that works with multiple backends
  - Created working ChromaVectorStore implementation
- ðŸŸ¨ Test with a sample book collection
  - Initial testing with 5 books successful
  - Need to scale testing to 100-500 books as planned
  - Need to validate query functionality and optimize retrieval
- â¬œ Future: Migrate to Pinecone when ready for production
